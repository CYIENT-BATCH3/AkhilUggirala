//WAP program to pass structure to a function.
/*Algorithm:
 1.include stdio.h and string.h libraries using preprocessor directives
 2.define struct student with name and age as members
 3.define a function record with no return type and structure variable as argument
 4.Initialize  the members of struct, use strcpy() for initializing the array of characters.
 5.call the function in main() and print the details of student in function.
